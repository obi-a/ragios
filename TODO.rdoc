=Goals for versions 0.5+

==todo
*Create a simple http server for Ragios that responds to REST requests. This will enable other apps to communicate with Ragios via REST. Example a Rails,Sinatra or javascript app could provide a Web UI for Ragios via REST. The datafeed from Ragios could be fed to webpage, blog or mobile app.

*Add ability to persist Ragios information and real-time statistics to a database. This will allow service performance monitoring overtime. It will also enable better monitor control.

==DONE
*Create a plugin architecture, so that all monitors (like HTTP, DNS,process monitors) are added as plugins. This will also allow developers to easily write customized plugins. OR easily install plugins written by other developers.
